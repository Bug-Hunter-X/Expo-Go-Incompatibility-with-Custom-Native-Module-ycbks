The problem was traced to a dependency conflict. My native module was using an older version of a library that was incompatible with the version used by Expo Go.  Updating the dependency in package.json and reinstalling resolved the problem.  The original buggy code (bug.js) and the corrected code are included for reference.  The Expo Go environment has very specific requirements for dependencies.  Carefully managing and vetting dependencies is essential for ensuring compatibility.
