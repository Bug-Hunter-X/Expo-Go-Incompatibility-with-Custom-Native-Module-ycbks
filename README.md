This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using a custom native module within an Expo app. The issue is specifically related to compatibility with Expo Go. The app functions correctly when built as a standalone app, but fails when run using Expo Go. This repo includes the buggy code, and a solution.  The solution involves identifying and addressing the source of the incompatibility between the native module and Expo Go's runtime environment. This could involve adjusting module configurations, dependencies, or other aspects of the module's interaction with Expo Go.
